# Agent Differences - RAG vs Advisor

## The Problem You Reported

Your **RAG Document Search Assistant** was acting like your **STOCK-AI Advisor** - greeting users with:
> "Hello! Welcome to STOCK-AI. I'm here to provide you with personalized stock trading advice. To get started, I'll need to gather some information to complete your trading profile..."

This was **WRONG** - the two agents have completely different roles!

### **What It DOES**
‚úÖ Search documents using the `retrieve_documents` tool
‚úÖ Answer questions based on retrieved documents

- "I'm 35 with $50k saved, what should I do?"

**Response Style:**

That's great that you're thinking about retirement! To provide you with 
the best advice, I'd like to know a bit more:

1. What's your current age?

3. Do you have any existing retirement accounts?

Based on this information, I can help you create a retirement savings plan 
tailored to your goals.
```

## Technical Implementation

### RAG Assistant (`/api/rag-chat`)

```typescript
import { RAG_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS } from "@/components/agent/rag-prompt"

const result = streamText({
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  system: RAG_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS,  // ‚úÖ Document search role
  messages: modelMessages,
  tools: {
    retrieve_documents: retrieveDocuments,  // ‚úÖ Has RAG tool
  },
})
```

**Key Features:**
- Uses specialized RAG system instructions
- Has `retrieve_documents` tool
- Temperature: 0.1 (more factual)
- Returns document sources

### Advisor (`/api/conversation`)

```typescript
const result = streamText({
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  system: ADVISOR_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS,  // ‚úÖ Personal advisor role
  messages: modelMessages,
  tools: {
    // Different tools for profile management
  },
})
```

**Key Features:**
- Uses advisor system instructions
- Has profile management tools
- Conversational style
- Tracks user information

---

## The Fix Applied

### 1. **Strengthened RAG Identity** ‚úÖ

Added clear identity markers to `components/agent/rag-prompt.ts`:

```typescript
You are a specialized **Document Search Assistant** for financial information. 
You are NOT a financial advisor. Your ONLY job is to help users find and 
understand information from financial documents.

## IDENTITY & GREETING
When users greet you (hello, hi, etc.), respond briefly with:
"Hello! I'm your Document Search Assistant. I can help you find information 
from our financial document library. What would you like to know about?"

DO NOT:
- Introduce yourself as a financial advisor
- Offer to create profiles or gather personal information
- Discuss financial planning or goals
- Act like a personal assistant
```

### 2. **Added Critical Reminders** ‚úÖ

```typescript
## CRITICAL IDENTITY REMINDERS

‚ùå **YOU ARE NOT:**
- A financial advisor
- A wealth planner
- A personal assistant
- A profile gathering system
- STOCK-AI advisor

‚úÖ **YOU ARE:**
- A document search assistant
- A financial information retriever
- A research helper for documents
```

### 3. **Updated UI for Clear Distinction** ‚úÖ

**Before:**
```tsx
<CardTitle>
  <Bot /> AI-RAG Assistant
</CardTitle>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<CardHeader className="bg-gradient-to-r from-indigo-50 to-blue-50">
  <CardTitle>
    <FileText className="text-indigo-600" />
    <div>
      <div>Document Search Assistant</div>
      <div className="text-xs">Search financial documents ‚Ä¢ Not a financial advisor</div>
    </div>
  </CardTitle>
</CardHeader>
```

### 4. **Updated Placeholder & Empty State** ‚úÖ

**Before:**
```
"Ask a question about your documents..."
```

**After:**
```
"Search financial documents... (e.g., 'What is a 401k?')"

Empty state shows:
- FileText icon (instead of Bot)
- "Search Financial Documents"
- Example queries
```

---

## Summary

The agents are now **clearly differentiated**:

1. **RAG Assistant** = Document search tool (indigo theme, FileText icon)
2. **STOCK-AI Advisor** = Personal stock trading advisor (blue theme, Bot icon)

The fix ensures the RAG assistant will NEVER:
- ‚ùå Introduce itself as STOCK-AI
- ‚ùå Offer to gather profile information
- ‚ùå Act as a financial advisor
- ‚ùå Discuss personal financial planning

Instead, it will:
- ‚úÖ Search documents
- ‚úÖ Provide factual information
- ‚úÖ Cite sources
- ‚úÖ Stay in its document search role

**Test it now by refreshing and typing "hello" in the RAG chat!** üöÄ
