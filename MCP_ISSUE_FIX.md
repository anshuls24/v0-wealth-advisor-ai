# MCP Issue Fix Summary

## üêõ Problem Identified

From your screenshot, the AI was trying to fetch AAPL market data but was hanging with "One moment please!" message. This indicated that:

1. **MCP connection was timing out** - The Polygon MCP server connection was taking too long or failing silently
2. **Request was blocking** - The entire conversation was waiting for MCP to respond
3. **No fallback** - If MCP failed, the conversation couldn't proceed

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Added 10-Second Timeout for MCP Connection**

**File:** `app/api/conversation/route.ts`

```typescript
// Add 10-second timeout for MCP connection
const mcpPromise = (async () => {
  const polygonClient = getPolygonMCPClient();
  await polygonClient.connect();
  const polygonTools = await polygonClient.getTools();
  return polygonTools;
})();

const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => 
  setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('MCP connection timeout (10s)')), 10000)
);

const polygonTools = await Promise.race([mcpPromise, timeoutPromise]);
```

**What this does:**
- If MCP takes longer than 10 seconds to connect, it will timeout
- The conversation will continue with RAG-only mode
- No more hanging "One moment please!" messages

---

### 2. **Graceful Fallback to RAG-Only Mode**

**File:** `app/api/conversation/route.ts`

```typescript
} catch (err) {
  console.error('‚ùå Conversation: Polygon MCP connection failed:', err);
  console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è Conversation: Falling back to profile-aware RAG only');
  console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è This is OK - RAG will still work for strategy recommendations');
}
```

**What this does:**
- If MCP fails or times out, the app continues with RAG
- RAG (Vectorize) will still provide strategy recommendations
- User gets valuable responses even without real-time market data

---

### 3. **Updated AI System Prompt**

**File:** `components/agent/prompt.ts`

Added instructions for the AI to handle MCP unavailability:

```
**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: If MCP tools are not available:**
- You only have retrieveKnowledgeBase available
- Focus on educational content and strategy recommendations
- Use user's profile to recommend suitable strategies
- Explain that real-time market data is temporarily unavailable
- Still provide valuable strategy education and planning advice
```

**What this does:**
- AI knows how to respond when MCP is unavailable
- AI will use RAG to provide strategy education
- AI won't hang waiting for market data
- User still gets helpful recommendations based on their profile

---

### 4. **Added Diagnostic Endpoint**

**File:** `app/api/diagnostic/route.ts` (NEW)

Access at: `https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api/diagnostic`

**What this does:**
- Shows status of all API keys
- Tests MCP connection
- Lists available tools
- Helps diagnose issues quickly

---

## üß™ How to Verify the Fix

### Step 1: Wait for Railway Deployment

Railway should auto-deploy in 2-3 minutes after the push.

---

### Step 2: Check Diagnostic Endpoint

Open in browser: `https://your-railway-url.up.railway.app/api/diagnostic`

**Expected output:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-24T...",
  "environment": "production",
  "apiKeys": {
    "openai": true,
    "polygon": true,
    "vectorize_token": true,
    "vectorize_org": true,
    "vectorize_pipeline": true
  },
  "mcp": {
    "status": "connected" or "failed" or "timeout",
    "error": null or "error message",
    "tools": ["get_snapshot_ticker", "list_ticker_news", ...]
  }
}
```

---

### Step 3: Test RAG Functionality (Most Important!)

**Query:** "What is a bull put credit spread?"

**Expected behavior:**
- Response should come back quickly (< 5 seconds)
- AI should explain the strategy in detail
- No hanging or timeout

**Check Railway logs for:**
```
üîß Tools called in this step: 1
  [1] Tool: retrieveKnowledgeBase
      Args: {"query":"bull put credit spread"}
‚úÖ Vectorize: Retrieved 5 documents from API
‚úÖ Tool results received: 1
```

**‚úÖ This confirms RAG is working!**

---

### Step 4: Test MCP Functionality (If Available)

**Query:** "What's SPY's current price?"

**Expected behavior:**

**If MCP works:**
- Response includes current price
- Logs show: `‚úÖ Polygon MCP connected`

**If MCP times out (10 seconds):**
- AI responds: "Real-time market data is temporarily unavailable"
- Logs show: `‚ùå MCP connection timeout (10s)`
- Logs show: `‚ö†Ô∏è Falling back to profile-aware RAG only`
- **Conversation continues normally with RAG**

---

### Step 5: Test Combined Query (Your Original AAPL Query)

**Query:** "Analyze AAPL market opportunities"

**Expected behavior:**

**Scenario A: MCP is working**
```
Step 1: AI calls get_snapshot_ticker (AAPL)
Step 2: AI calls list_ticker_news (AAPL)
Step 3: AI calls retrieveKnowledgeBase (strategy query)
Step 4: AI synthesizes comprehensive recommendation
```

**Scenario B: MCP times out (NEW FIX)**
```
Step 1: MCP timeout after 10 seconds
Step 2: AI acknowledges market data unavailable
Step 3: AI calls retrieveKnowledgeBase (profile-based query)
Step 4: AI provides strategy recommendations based on profile
```

**‚úÖ Either way, you get a response - no more hanging!**

## üìä Railway Logs to Watch

After deployment, check Railway logs for these key indicators:

### **Successful MCP Connection:**
```
üè≠ Production mode detected - attempting to load Polygon MCP tools...
üîå Connecting to Polygon MCP server...
‚úÖ Polygon MCP connected, fetching tools...
‚úÖ Conversation: Added 15 Polygon MCP tools
üìã Conversation: Total tools available: 16 (RAG + MCP)
```

### **MCP Timeout (Expected if uvx/Python issues):**
```
üè≠ Production mode detected - attempting to load Polygon MCP tools...
üîå Connecting to Polygon MCP server...
‚ùå Conversation: Polygon MCP connection failed: Error: MCP connection timeout (10s)
‚ö†Ô∏è Conversation: Falling back to profile-aware RAG only
‚ö†Ô∏è This is OK - RAG will still work for strategy recommendations
```

### **RAG Working (Most Important):**
```
üîß Tools called in this step: 1
  [1] Tool: retrieveKnowledgeBase
üîç Vectorize: Retrieving documents for: "bull put credit spread"
‚úÖ Vectorize: Retrieved 5 documents from API
‚úÖ Tool results received: 1
```

---

## üéØ What You Should See Now

1. **No more hanging** - Responses come back within 10-15 seconds max
2. **RAG is confirmed working** - Strategy recommendations are provided
3. **Graceful degradation** - If MCP fails, RAG continues to work
4. **Better error messages** - AI explains when market data is unavailable

---

## üîç Confirming RAG Was Called (From Your Screenshot)

Looking at your screenshot, the AI provided:
1. **Bull Put Credit Spread** - detailed strategy explanation
2. **Naked Call Sell** - strategy details
3. **Iron Condor** - strategy details

**This strongly suggests RAG was called!** These detailed strategy explanations come from the Vectorize knowledge base, not from general AI knowledge.

To 100% confirm, check Railway logs for:
```
üîß Tools called in this step: 1
  [1] Tool: retrieveKnowledgeBase
```

---

## üö® If MCP Still Causes Issues

### **Option 1: Disable MCP Temporarily**

Add this to Railway environment variables:
```
DISABLE_MCP=true
```

Then modify `app/api/conversation/route.ts`:
```typescript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' && !process.env.DISABLE_MCP) {
  // MCP connection code
}
```

### **Option 2: Fix MCP Connection**

The most common issues:
1. **uvx not in PATH** - Check `railway.toml` has `nixPkgs = ["python311", "uv"]`
2. **Python version mismatch** - Railway needs Python 3.11+
3. **Polygon API key invalid** - Regenerate from Polygon.io dashboard

To fix:
1. Delete Railway service completely
2. Recreate from GitHub repo (forces fresh build)
3. Ensure all environment variables are set
4. Redeploy

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

After this fix, you should have:

- [x] Responses within 10-15 seconds (no hanging)
- [x] RAG provides strategy recommendations
- [x] Profile-aware responses (beginner, moderate risk, etc.)
- [x] Graceful handling of MCP failures
- [x] Detailed logging in Railway for debugging
- [x] Diagnostic endpoint for quick status checks

---

## üìù Next Steps

1. **Test the app after Railway deployment** (2-3 minutes)
2. **Check diagnostic endpoint** to see MCP status
3. **Ask strategy questions** to confirm RAG is working
4. **Check Railway logs** to see which tools are being called
5. **Report back** with any errors or issues

**The key improvement: Even if MCP is broken, RAG will continue to work and provide valuable strategy recommendations based on your profile!** üöÄ
