# üéØ Profile Injection Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ **What Was Implemented**

### **1. Profile-Aware RAG Tool**
**File:** `components/agent/tools/retrieve-documents.ts`

- Created `createRetrieveDocumentsTool(userProfile)` factory function
- Profile is passed via closure to tool execution
- Query enhancement with profile context tags
- Result context includes profile constraints
- Comprehensive logging of profile usage

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Enhances queries: `"bull put spread [risk_tolerance:moderate experience:intermediate]"`
- ‚úÖ Appends profile context to results
- ‚úÖ Logs profile data on every tool call
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible (default export without profile)

---

### **2. Profile Injection in Conversation Route**
**File:** `app/api/conversation/route.ts`

- Receives profile from frontend request body
- Creates profile-aware RAG tool with user's profile
- Injects profile into system prompt
- Logs profile context when tools are called
- Tracks profile completion percentage

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Profile received: `const { profile: clientProfile } = await req.json()`
- ‚úÖ Tool creation: `const profileAwareRAGTool = createRetrieveDocumentsTool(updatedProfile)`
- ‚úÖ System prompt injection: Profile summary added to AI context
- ‚úÖ Tool logging: `onStepFinish` logs profile with every tool call

---

### **3. Profile Injection in News-Strategy Route**
**File:** `app/api/news-strategy/route.ts`

- Receives profile from request body
- Creates profile-aware RAG tool
- Builds profile-aware system prompt
- Logs profile context on tool calls

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Profile typing: `userProfile?: ClientProfile`
- ‚úÖ Profile logging on request
- ‚úÖ Profile-aware tool creation
- ‚úÖ Tool call logging with profile context

---

## üìä **How Profile Flows Through the System**

```
Frontend (app/page.tsx)
  ‚Üì (sends profile with every message)
Backend (app/api/conversation/route.ts)
  ‚Üì (receives profile, creates profile-aware tools)
RAG Tool (components/agent/tools/retrieve-documents.ts)
  ‚Üì (enhances query, appends profile to results)
AI Agent (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini)
  ‚Üì (reads profile from system prompt + tool results)
Response (tailored to user's risk, experience, preferences)
```

---

## üîç **Profile Data Injected Into:**

### **1. RAG Tool Query Enhancement**
```typescript
Original Query: "bull put spread strategy"
Enhanced Query: "bull put spread strategy [risk_tolerance:moderate experience:intermediate strategy:credit_spreads]"
```

### **2. RAG Tool Result Context**
```
--- USER PROFILE CONTEXT ---
Risk Tolerance: moderate
Options Experience: intermediate
Preferred Strategy: credit_spreads
Preferred Underlyings: SPY, QQQ

IMPORTANT: Tailor your response to match this user's profile.
```

### **3. System Prompt**
```
## CURRENT USER PROFILE:
- Goals: Generate consistent income
- Risk Tolerance: moderate
- Experience: intermediate
- Strategy Preference: credit_spreads
- Preferred Underlyings: SPY, QQQ

Profile Completion: 75%

Use this profile information to tailor your questions and recommendations.
```

### **4. Tool Execution Logs**
```
üîß Conversation: Initializing tools with user profile...
üë§ Conversation: Profile being injected: {
  hasProfile: true,
  riskTolerance: 'moderate',
  experience: 'intermediate',
  strategyPref: 'credit_spreads',
  completion: '75%'
}
```

---

## üß™ **Testing Profile Injection**

### **Step 1: Build a Profile**
Chat with the AI:
```
User: "I want to generate income from options"
AI: [Extracts goal, updates profile]

User: "I'm comfortable with moderate risk"
AI: [Extracts risk tolerance, updates profile]

User: "I prefer credit spreads on SPY"
AI: [Extracts strategy preference and underlying, updates profile]
```

### **Step 2: Check Console Logs**
Open browser DevTools ‚Üí Console, look for:

```
‚úÖ Profile updated with 1 changes
üîß Conversation: Initializing tools with user profile...
üë§ Conversation: Profile being injected: {
  hasProfile: true,
  riskTolerance: 'moderate',
  experience: 'intermediate',
  strategyPref: 'credit_spreads',
  completion: '60%'
}
```

### **Step 3: Trigger Tool Usage**
Ask a strategy question:
```
User: "What's a good strategy for bullish SPY?"
```

Check console for:
```
üîç RAG Tool: Executing document retrieval for: "bullish SPY strategy"
üë§ RAG Tool: User Profile Received: {
  hasProfile: true,
  riskTolerance: 'moderate',
  experience: 'intermediate',
  strategyPref: 'credit_spreads',
  preferredUnderlyings: ['SPY']
}
üéØ RAG Tool: Enhanced query with profile: "bullish SPY strategy [risk_tolerance:moderate experience:intermediate strategy:credit_spreads]"
‚úÖ RAG Tool: Retrieved 5 documents with profile context
```

### **Step 4: Verify Response**
AI should respond with:
- ‚úÖ Strategies matching user's risk tolerance (moderate)
- ‚úÖ Strategies matching user's experience (intermediate)
- ‚úÖ Strategies matching user's preference (credit spreads)
- ‚úÖ Strategies for user's preferred underlying (SPY)

## üìù **Key Changes Made**

### **1. New Function: `createRetrieveDocumentsTool()`**
- Factory function that creates profile-aware RAG tool
- Accepts `userProfile?: ClientProfile | null`
- Returns tool with profile injected via closure

### **2. Enhanced Tool Execution**
- Query enhancement with profile tags
- Result context appends profile constraints
- Comprehensive logging of profile data

### **3. Updated API Routes**
- `/api/conversation`: Creates profile-aware RAG tool
- `/api/news-strategy`: Creates profile-aware RAG tool
- Both routes log profile context on tool calls

### **4. Added Logging**
- Profile injection logs in conversation route
- Profile reception logs in RAG tool
- Tool call logs with profile context
- Tool result logs

## üöÄ **Profile Storage Strategy**

### **Current Implementation: Temporary (Per-Request)**

**Frontend:**
- ‚úÖ Profile stored in `localStorage`
- ‚úÖ Profile sent with every message
- ‚úÖ Profile persists across page refreshes

**Backend:**
- ‚úÖ Profile received with each request
- ‚úÖ Profile passed to tools via closure
- ‚úÖ Profile injected into system prompt
- ‚ùå Profile NOT stored in database
- ‚ùå Profile NOT persisted on server

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ No database required
- ‚úÖ Privacy-friendly (no server-side storage)
- ‚úÖ Works immediately without authentication
- ‚úÖ Profile available until user clears browser data

**Limitations:**
- ‚ùå Profile lost if user switches devices
- ‚ùå No cross-device sync
