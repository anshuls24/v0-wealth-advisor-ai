üö¢ **Deployment**

## Render Deployment (Recommended - Best Value!) ‚≠ê

**Best for**: Full Stock MCP Server functionality with Polygon.io integration at the best price!

See detailed guide: [RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md](./RENDER_DEPLOYMENT.md)

**Quick Start:**
1. Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`
2. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
3. Click "New +" ‚Üí "Web Service"
4. Select your repository
5. Add environment variables:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key
   - `POLYGON_API_KEY`: Your Polygon.io API key
6. Click "Create Web Service" - Render auto-deploys! üöÄ

**Why Render?**
- ‚úÖ Supports STDIO-based MCP servers (Polygon.io integration works!)
- ‚úÖ Python/uvx support built-in
- ‚úÖ **Free tier**: 750 hrs/month (great for testing!)
- ‚úÖ **Starter tier**: Only $7/month (always-on)
- ‚úÖ No serverless timeouts
- ‚úÖ Auto-deploy from GitHub

---

## Railway Deployment (Alternative)

**Best for**: Excellent developer experience

See detailed guide: [RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md](./RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md)

**Why Railway?**
- ‚úÖ Supports STDIO-based MCP servers
- ‚úÖ Python/uvx support built-in
- ‚úÖ Great DX (developer experience)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ~$10-15/month (no free tier)

---

## Vercel Deployment (For Main App Only)

**Best for**: Fast deployment without Stock MCP Server

Push to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```

Import to Vercel:
1. Go to vercel.com
2. Import your repository
3. Add environment variables:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note about Stock MCP Server on Vercel:**
The Stock MCP Server (Polygon.io integration) requires spawning a Python subprocess (`uvx`), which is **not supported** on Vercel's serverless platform. The button will appear but show a "tools temporarily unavailable" error when clicked. For full MCP functionality, deploy to Railway instead.

## Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...your-key-here

# Optional (for future Supabase integration)
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

üìä **Profile Management System**

## Profile Schema

```typescript
interface ClientProfile {
  goals: {
    short_term: string | null;
    medium_term: string | null;
    long_term: string | null;
  };
  risk: {
    tolerance: string | null;
    history: string | null;
  };
  financials: {
    income: string | null;
    assets: string | null;
    expenses: string | null;
  };
  time_horizon: string | null;
  preferences: string[];
  expectations: string[];
}
```

## Completion Tracking

- **Flexible Requirements**: Only 2 of 3 goals needed, 1 preference, 1 expectation
- **Real-time Updates**: Profile completion percentage calculated dynamically
- **Summary Generation**: Automatic profile summaries at 75% and 100% completion
- **User Verification**: Editable summaries with confirmation workflow

üîç **RAG System (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**

## Overview

The RAG system provides document-based Q&A capabilities, allowing users to query financial documents and receive accurate, source-cited responses. This system is completely isolated from the main chat advisor to ensure focused document retrieval without profile-building interference.

## Key Features

- **Document Retrieval**: Semantic search through financial documents with relevance scoring
- **Source Citations**: Every response includes document sources with titles, URLs, and relevance scores
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time response generation with manual streaming parser
- **Complete Isolation**: Separate from advisor chat to prevent cross-contamination
- **Mock Implementation**: Currently uses mock financial documents for demonstration

## Behavior Update (Sep 2025)

- Simplified, conversational system prompt for RAG to reduce brittleness and generic replies
- Relaxed greeting filter: only exact greetings (e.g., "hi", "hello") return the canned onboarding line; short queries like "IRA" now pass through to retrieval
- Lower temperature to 0.1 for focused, factual answers; capped response length (`maxTokens: 500`)
- Sources are returned via the `X-Document-Sources` response header and displayed in the UI
- Tip: If you get the greeting line, try a more specific query or avoid pure greeting words

Example queries that work well now:
- "IRA"
- "Roth IRA vs Traditional IRA"
- "Portfolio diversification basics"
- "What is wealth management?"

## Architecture

```typescript
// Document Interface
interface VectorizeDocument {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  metadata?: {
    title?: string;
    source?: string;
    url?: string;
  };
  score?: number;
}

// RAG Response Format
interface RAGResponse {
  documents: VectorizeDocument[];
  query: string;
  total_results: number;
}
```

## Mock Document Collection

The system includes comprehensive financial documents covering:

- **Financial Planning**: Comprehensive strategy creation and goal setting
- **Investment Diversification**: Risk management and portfolio construction
- **Risk Tolerance**: Understanding and assessing investment risk preferences
- **Retirement Planning**: 401(k), IRA, and retirement income strategies
- **Emergency Funds**: Building financial security and emergency preparedness

## Usage Examples

**Query**: "What is wealth management?"
**Response**: Combines information from multiple documents about financial planning, investment diversification, and risk management, with full source citations.

**Query**: "How should I diversify my portfolio?"
**Response**: Retrieves and synthesizes information from investment diversification documents with specific strategies and recommendations.

## Technical Implementation

- **Endpoint**: `/api/rag-chat` - Dedicated RAG processing endpoint
- **Client**: `components/rag-chat.tsx` - Isolated chat interface with source display
- **Service**: `lib/vectorize.ts` - Mock document retrieval with keyword matching
- **Streaming**: Custom streaming parser for real-time response display
- **Debugging**: Comprehensive logging for document retrieval and AI responses

## Future Enhancements

- **Real Vectorize.io Integration**: Replace mock implementation with actual vector database
- **Document Upload**: Allow users to upload their own financial documents
- **Advanced Search**: Implement semantic similarity search with embeddings
- **Document Management**: Add, edit, and organize document collections
