OptionsAI:
[Calls retrieveKnowledgeBase for credit spread strategies]

"Based on your profile (beginner, moderate risk, income-focused, 21-day horizon), 
here are the top 3 strategies I recommend:

## 1. Bull Put Credit Spread (Best Match) ‚≠ê
**Why it fits:**
- ‚úÖ Defined-risk (matches your preference)
- ‚úÖ Beginner-friendly
- ‚úÖ Generates consistent income
- ‚úÖ Works in neutral-to-bullish markets
- ‚úÖ No assignment risk if managed

**How it works:**
Sell a put at strike A, buy a put at strike B (lower). Collect premium upfront.
Max profit: Premium received
Max loss: (Strike A - Strike B) - Premium

**Example on SPY (your preferred underlying):**
- Sell SPY $560 put
- Buy SPY $555 put
- Collect $1.50 credit
- Max profit: $150
- Max loss: $350
- Hold for 21 days or close at 50-70% profit

**When to use:** When you're neutral-to-bullish on SPY over next 2-4 weeks
